# Requirements
You might have Python 3.9.5+ to run this code. I suggest installing this one as it's what I use:
https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-396/

_Note: I run Windows 10. Pythong 3.9+ is **not** supported on Windows 7, so if you're keeping the dream alive, don't get your hopes up. Also, Windows 7 has been deprecated and no longer receives security fixes. But you know that and you like to live dangerously._

# Setup
1. Download the project. Most users should just download a .zip

2. Put it somewhere safe.
3. Run `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` in your favorite command interpreter / shell environment.
   If you're a Windows user, you can run `setup.cmd` and it will do it for you. 

# Running AP
After completing Setup, run `python main.py` in your favorite command interpreter / shell envrionment.
If you're a Windows user, you can use `run.cmd` instead.

# Developer Notes
I'm fairly new to Python and DearPyGui (and ImGui for that matter). This was made on a shoestring budget (read: $0), so the level of code smell is high. It's what you might call a passion project. I wrote it for myself but drew inspiration from friends in the Parallel community which informed certain features. I hope you find it useful. Unless you're sponsoring me, I can't promise that I'll find time to service your particular problem or request, but I'll do my best as time avails.

# Bugs
Please report any issues to https://github.com/JERisBRISK/archivists-pride/issues. Be as detailed as you can. I appreciate can't promise I'll fix them any time soon (or ever), but I hate bugs in my code so chances are high that if I can reproduce the problem, I'll get around to it.

# Testing
Note that I am a Windows 10 guy. I don't run or test AP on any other platform, but it is built on cross-platform technologies like Python, 

# AP is dedicated with love and gratitude to
- The Parallel community. Y'all are nuts, and you're fam, and I love you. Join up at http://discord.gg/parallelalpha
- The Parallel team. See http://www.twitter.com/ParallelNFT and https://parallel.life/ to figure out what the heck this is all about.
- The DearPyGui team and its contributors. https://github.com/hoffstadt and https://github.com/Pcothren brought ImGui to Python, which lets me bring this app to you.
- Omar Cornut (https://github.com/ocornut) for ImGui, the underpinnings of DearPyGui.
- The authors of Python's many helpful packages like requests, web3, Dumper, etc.
